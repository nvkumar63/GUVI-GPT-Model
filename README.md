Deployment GUVI GPT Model using Hugging Face

Overview
The GPT2 GUVI LLM project leverages the GPT-2 architecture to generate content related to Guvi's corporate training programs. The project aims to develop a language model capable of generating industry-relevant descriptions, training material, and summaries for tech-focused education.

Project Objectives
Generate realistic and coherent text related to Guvi’s mission of bridging the gap between academia and industry.
Provide course descriptions and training paths in areas such as cloud computing, web development, and data science.
Enable customization of training content based on industry needs.
Features
GPT-2 based language generation: Fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate content specific to the Guvi training platform.
Industry-Specific Content Generation: Focuses on generating content in tech domains, especially cloud computing, data science, and web development.
Flexible Outputs: Can generate course descriptions, learning paths, and training materials based on input prompts.
